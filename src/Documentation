FINGERPRINTS :
=================

* SiMaps_compare :
--> Inputs :
    - Run the script
    - Specify the index of the example. The images and score will appear in a 'examplei' file in the output folder 
    - Specify first and second SMILES of the moelcules you want to compare
--> Outputs :
    - Side by side represenations of the two molecules
    - Similarity maps for the two molecules for both of the fingerprints (Morgan and ASP)
    - Text file containing SMILES and Tanimoto scores

SENSIBILITY :
=================
|| Data Visualisation :
* visualisation :
- plot_distrib : generates figure 21 from paper
- histogram : generates figure 20 from paper

|| Probability analysis :
* visualisation :
- showVari : generate figure 23 from paper
- plot_Simulated_Distributions : generates figure 22 from paper

|| Data base analysis :
* visualisation :
- delta_heatmap : generates figure 26 and 27 from paper
- plotWt : generates figure 24 from paper
- visualize_weights_enveloppes : generates figure 25 from paper

=================
PROPOSAL :
=================
* function_analysis :
- plotf : generates figure 33 from paper
- comparef : generates figure 30 and 34 from paper
- plotDiff : generates a figure that does not appear in paper, indicating the error of prediction for each data point
