* SiMaps_compare :
--> Inputs :
    - Run the script
    - Specify the index of the example. The images and score will appear in a 'examplei' file in the output folder 
    - Specify first and second SMILES of the moelcules you want to compare
--> Outputs :
    - Side by side represenations of the two molecules
    - Similarity maps for the two molecules for both of the fingerprints (Morgan and ASP)
    - Text file containing SMILES and Tanimoto scores
